# UAV Flight Planner

The planning of the flight and the management of the
navigation of UAV is essential in order to identify the
optimal route depending on the position and height of
possible obstacles present in the operating zone. Thus
it is essential to trace a path in terms of planimetry and
altimetry.  

Further addition includes detection of areas under shadow using the position of the sun as well as altitude data of the surrounding areas, and using ray tracing from the location on the ground to the sun and checking if any obstacle is encountered. Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm is used along with rasterized maps to achieve the task.
